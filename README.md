Cypress Automation API PET 🧪
============
## Introduction
The main objective of this project is to use the pet store API effectively to create users, retrieve data of sold pets and perform an analysis of pets with similar names. In addition, we seek to integrate these processes into automation cases using Cypress, JavaScript and Cucumber, in order to improve the efficiency and reliability of operations related to pet data management on the platform.

## Upcoming Features 🚀 
  - Tests e2e Cypress. 

## Starting 🌎

1. User Creation: Perform an HTTP request to create a user in the platform and later retrieve their data, using API https://petstore.swagger.io/

2. Collecting Sold Pets Data: Use HTTP requests to obtain JSON data from the /pet/findByStatus endpoint and create a list containing the names of the sold pets, presented in a specific format.

2. Analysis of Pets by Name: Create a class to analyze the list of pet names sold, identifying how many of them share the same name and presenting the results.
